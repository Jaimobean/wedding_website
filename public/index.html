        <h2>Previously...</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          She said it first in December, the two of them snuggled up in chunky knitwear and the moody lighting of an overpriced Berlin
          hotel. He had intended to say it but she beat him to it.
        </p>

        <p>
          They had met when she was brand new to London and he was drunk and talking about runner beans. He took her to places he thought
          were old and was afraid because he thought he might really like her, and she thought that was stupid so they started
          going out.
        </p>

        <p>
          In Berlin, the two of them would get caught in a stairwell wearing bathrobes and then attempt to explain that it wasn’t what
          it looked like. It really wasn’t. In the Jewish museum he would get sad teary at the memorial and then happy teary
          at the yarmulke adorned with the cast of Friends. They'd walk around a chintzy Christmas market designed to trap
          tourists, and then randomly stumble upon another one that looked like it was for locals. The glühwein would taste
          the same at both.
        </p>

        <p>
          He would convince her to move with him to South London a month later, but she would tell him that she worried about him living
          with her cat. She would later worry about how he'd react when they had to live without the cat. The cat, meanwhile,
          was extremely comfortable with having two humans who would now constantly do her bidding.
        </p>

        <p>
          Their tiny house became their home, one she filled with flowers, art and jazz and he filled with videogames, biscuits and
          cables. He hated trains and she loved to travel. She would walk around the park and become friends with every dog
          and cat in the area. They often worked late but always enjoyed cooking for each other in their tiny kitchen they
          both hated.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another six months later they would squabble in a Cape Cod boutique about the price of flip flops. She was right: he still
          wears them. He was right: he didn’t need them. They would both be lonely when the other was out of town.
        </p>

        <p>
          She phoned her parents every day. When she introduced him to her family he felt like he had known them for months. He begrudgingly
          visited home twice a year. When he introduced his family to her, she made him feel closer to the town he’d spent
          most of his life trying to avoid.
        </p>

        <p>
          They became aunties and uncles and would look at houses and make plans of their own, and then look at different houses and
          make different plans. It was always exciting thinking of what may happen in all their different houses as they
          lived out all their different plans.
        </p>

        <p>
          But all of that was still to come when she first said it in that overpriced Berlin hotel, though as they hugged silently
          in the moments after he knew it would always turn out like this.
        </p>

        <p>
          “I love you too,” he said.

            <p>From there, you can either rent a car and drive straight to the Cape (about 90 min) OR get the Plymouth &

              on the Cape, just not in massive quantities). The Langsen family has taken a lot of those buses over the years
              and this is a good option if you're coordinating with a larger group with a car arriving at a different time.

              Flights from London to Boston Logan Airport include Virgin Atlantic from Heathrow and Norweigan from Gatwick, though we'd
              recommend the former over the latter. You can rent a car to travel from Logan to Cape Cod, or alternatively
              ride the
              <a href="https://www.p-b.com/">
                <em>Plymouth &amp; Brockton Street Railway Co</em>
              </a> - which we'd call a bus.

            <p>Those travelling to the US from the UK will need a valid ESTA, which can be
              <a href="https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta/">applied for online</a> and costs $14 (about £11). These are pretty
              quick to process so we'd recommend you fill in the form about a month before your flight. It's all electronic
              so you won't need to print anything out.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>You'll need to fill out a landing card (which will be handed out on your flight) so it's usually a pretty
              good idea to pack a pen in your carry on luggage. Also, people who carry a pen always look smart.</p>

              Americans do not get a great deal of public holidays so this is quite a big occasion.

      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <hr />
      <section>
        <h3>Are children invited to the wedding?</h3>
        <p>While we love spending time with your littles, the venue is beautiful but not kid-friendly. If you will have an
          infant that you need to keep near you, let us know as soon you can and we'll look into whether we can arrange a
          nursing room. Otherwise, the Cape loves families and there are professional sitter services locally for Saturday
          night if you'd still like to bring the whole family out for the long weekend.</p>
        <h3>How do I get to Cape Cod?</h3>
        <p>You start by booking a flight into Boston's Logan International Airport. From there, you can either rent a car
          and drive straight to the Cape (about 90 min) OR get the Plymouth & Brockton bus from the airport to Hyannis or
          Barnstable and request a ride from there (Uber and Lyft do exist on the Cape, just not in massive quantities).
          The Langsen family has taken a lot of those buses over the years and this is a good option if you're coordinating
          with a larger group with a car arriving at a different time. There's more on travel (from both the US and UK) over
          here, too.</p>
        <h3>Where should we stay?</h3>
        <p>That's SUCH a good question that we made a special section for it. The short answer? You've got options. The wedding
          is at Wychmere Beach Club so center your searches around Harwich, Dennis, Chatham, Brewster and Orleans.</p>
        <h3>How do I get to the wedding?</h3>
        <p>There is parking at the venue if you'd like to drive, otherwise an Uber or taxi will do the trick. If you're staying
          in Harwichport, you may even be able to walk as it's very close to Main St!
        </p>
        <h3>What's the vibe?</h3>
        <p>Jessi's very glad you asked: English Garden on Cape Cod. That doesn't actually mean much for you though, so wear
          what you're comfortable in and consider it beach smart. Martin and his groomsmen will be in navy suits, bridesmaids
          will be in whatever floral thing they like best and Jessi's in white. Hats and fascinators are encouraged because
          Jessi absolutely loves them.</p>
        <h3>Is anything going on the rest of the weekend?</h3>
        <p>Friday night we'll be at Swan River in Dennisport for welcome drinks from 8pm after the rehearsal and BOY WILL
          WE BE HAPPY TO SEE YOU! Sunday after the wedding, we'll pick a beach and set up shop with coffee and several boxes
          of donuts and muffins from the Hole in One. We'll confirm this one closer in but as with Friday, everybody's welcome.
          Martin also has a hunch the next Avengers movie will be coming out at this time, so a discreet cinema trip may
          be planned...</p>
        <h3>What's the weather going to be like?</h3>
        <p>New England, much like Olde England, could do almost anything in May. It could be a gentle rain over a cool, moody
          bay. It could be summer sun and blue skies. Layers are encouraged, we promise it's beautiful either way and we
          chose the venue because it's beautiful no matter the weather.</p>
        <h3>What should I eat?</h3>
        <p>If I could make you a BINGO card, I would. Some Langsen favorites include Arnolds or PJ's for the best beachy
          junk food fix, Sundae School or the Chocolate Sparrow for an ice cream cone, Blackfish or Viera for a nice dinner
          out, the Red Inn for dinner and the Governor Bradford for drag queen karaoke in Provincetown.</p>
        <h3>When we're not at the wedding, what should we do?</h3>
        <p>Rent bikes and take on the beautiful, forested Cape Cod rail trail, take the ferry to Nantucket or Martha's Vineyard,
          check out the shops in Chatham or the galleries in Wellfleet, visit the National Seashore for a walk along some
          of the world's most beautiful beaches, go whale watching out of Provincetown and treat yourself to a walk down
          Commercial Street afterward. Cape Cod's little towns are so sweet and full of independent shops and artists--we
          cannot wait to share this very special place with each of you.</p>
